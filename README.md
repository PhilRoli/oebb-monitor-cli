# ÖBB Monitor

Terminal UI for live ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) departure and arrival data, streamed via WebSocket.

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap philroli/tap
brew install oebb-monitor
```

### Build from source

Requires Rust 1.80+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philroli/oebb-monitor
cd oebb-monitor
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
oebb-monitor            # start at Wien Westbahnhof (default)
oebb-monitor --version  # print version
oebb-monitor --debug    # write debug log to /tmp/oebb-debug.log
```

### Keybindings

| `↑` / `↓` | Move selection |
| `Enter` | Open detail view |
| `A` | Switch to arrivals |
| `D` | Switch to departures |
| `S` | Search / change station |
| `R` | Reconnect and refresh |

## Features

- Live departures and arrivals for all 844 ÖBB stations
- Delay indicator with colour coding: on time (green), up to 5 min late (yellow), over 5 min late (red)
- Train detail view: intermediate stops, formation with wagon amenities (Wi-Fi, bicycle, wheelchair, bistro), operator, remarks
- German / English UI, toggled live with `L`; auto-detected from your locale on first run and remembered in `~/.config/oebb-monitor/config`
- Data stays live regardless of which mode is active (detail view, station search)
- Parallel loading across 5 WebSocket pages for full coverage
- Terminal cleaned up automatically on panic

Note: live feed text (station names, destinations, remarks, notices) is provided by ÖBB in German only and is shown as-is in both UI languages.

## Debugging

```bash
oebb-monitor --debug
# in a second terminal:
tail -f /tmp/oebb-debug.log
```

The log captures WebSocket events, reconnect signals, item merges, and key input.

## Architecture

Single-binary Rust application, split into focused modules under `src/`:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `main.rs` | Terminal setup/teardown, input + redraw event loop |
| `app.rs` | Application state and pure helpers (with unit tests) |
| `model.rs` | Serde types for the WebSocket JSON payloads |
| `ws.rs` | Background task maintaining the live connection |
| `ui.rs` | All terminal rendering |
| `lang.rs` | German/English UI strings and the language toggle |
| `config.rs` | Persisted settings (the chosen language) |
| `debug.rs` | Opt-in file logger and the `debug!` macro |

| Crate | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ratatui | 0.30 | TUI framework |
| crossterm | 0.29 | Terminal backend |
| tokio | 1 | Async runtime |
| tokio-tungstenite | 0.29 | WebSocket client |
| serde / serde_json | 1 | JSON deserialisation |
| chrono | 0.4 | Time formatting |
| anyhow | 1 | Error handling |
